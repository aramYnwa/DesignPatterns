**Decorator**

Why we need it ?
The decorator design pattern allows us to dynamically add functionality 
and behavior to an object without affecting the behavior of other existing objects in the same class.

Instead of extending using inheritance, which will change affect all objects of the class, 
we can use Decorator to extend the behaviour for some concrete object at runtime.
